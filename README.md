# Introduction
Modern smart homes are increasingly challenged by the need for efficient energy management and sustainable electricity usage. Smart Home Forecaster introduces an advanced LSTM-driven platform to address these issues by predicting future energy consumption patterns. Utilizing sophisticated deep learning algorithms, it processes temporal data, including historical load patterns and potentially weather conditions, to forecast electricity usage for upcoming periods. This data-centric approach empowers smart home systems with actionable insights, enabling proactive energy management to reduce costs while promoting ecological sustainability.

# Problem Statement and Objective
Smart home systems often lack the predictive capabilities needed to optimize energy usage patterns efficiently. This project aims to tackle issues such as energy wastage, peak load management, and inefficient resource allocation by developing a system that:
- Analyzes historical electricity consumption patterns.
- Provides accurate forecasts based on time series data.
- Enhances energy efficiency by anticipating future load requirements.
- Implements the solution on resource-constrained SBCs for practical smart home applications.
